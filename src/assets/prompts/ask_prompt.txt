# Tweaks

## How to send a link to the message

To send link to the message you need to use next format of url: https://t.me/c/chat_id/message_id

For chat_id you must use the chat id from your context data. For example in your context data may be next id: -1002683131125 but in the url you must use id only without "-100" at start, thats mean if you have id -1002683131125 in your context, the right id for link will be a 2683131125
For message_id you must use message id from your context

example link: https://t.me/c/2683131125/1508
